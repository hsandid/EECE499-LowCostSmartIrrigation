- Set-up a web server on the Raspberry-Pi board, using *Apache*.


### Smart Irrigation Controller - Web Interface

- Discuss the newly-added map interface
- Discuss the newly-added registration process
- Current Python scripts are redundant with the web interface. Implement python scripts which runs continually in the background
- Re-discuss the "Irrigation Control Method" from last meeting, and clarify how it should be implemented. How much will we rely on algorithms to control the irrigation routine ? How much control should we give to the user ?


### Upcoming Report

- Raspberry-Pi 3 Model B Hardware \ Interfaces \ Power & Voltage & Current Limitations.
- Raspberry-Pi Zero Hardware \ Interfaces \ Power & Voltage & Current Limitations.
- Linux distribution to use, if we are going to ship a product out commercially (i.e. Legal Issues, and lightweight distribution).
- Power supply solutions to make the Rasp. Pi portable using external batteries and solar power. 
- Requirements of the LoRa interface, especially when connected with a Raspberry-Pi.


### Post-Meeting Decisions

- Add a history/logs page to the web interface
- Add a scheduling page on the web interface
