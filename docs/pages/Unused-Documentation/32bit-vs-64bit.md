# 32-bit CPU vs 64-bit CPU

- 32-bit processors support up to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^{32} "> bytes of memory, or around <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=4">GB of memory.
- 64-bit processors support up to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^{64} "> bytes of memory, or around  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=17*10^{9}"> GB of memory.

- Raspberry-Pi OS (*a.k.a.* Raspbian OS) only has a 32-bit version. It is designed to run on all Raspberry-Pi boards, including earlier versions which had a 32-bit processors only.

  - 64-bit processors support both 32-bit and 64-bit OSes.
  - 32-bit processors support only 32-bit OSes.

- 32-bit support is being slowly dropped. We may have to migrate our system to a 64-bit system, and 64-bit software.
