## Overview

Drip irrigation is a technique in which water flows through a filter into special drip pipes, with emitters located at different spacing. Water is distributed through the emitters directly into the soil near the roots through a special slow-release device. Water can be more precisely applied to the plant roots, compared to other irrigation systems. Drip irrigation is adaptable to any farmable slope and is suitable for most soils.

*Example of a Drip Irrigation System :*

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| High water application efficiency and lower labor costs | Expensive initial cost can be more than overhead systems (commercial system)  |
| Minimized fertilizer/nutrient loss due to localized application and reduced leaching | The sun can affect the tubes used for drip irrigation, shortening their usable life  |
| Ability to irrigate irregular shaped fields. Levelling of the field not necessary  | If the water is not properly filtered and the equipment not properly maintained, it can result in clogging  |
| Allows safe use of recycled (waste-) water | Drip irrigation might be unsatisfactory if herbicides or top dressed fertilizers need sprinkler irrigation for activation |
| Moisture within the root zone can be maintained at field capacity and minimized soil erosion | Waste of water, time & harvest, if not installed properly  |
| Soil type plays less important role in frequency of irrigation  | Systems require careful study of all the relevant factors like land topography, soil, water, crop and agro-climatic conditions, and suitability of drip irrigation system and its components  |
| Highly uniform distribution of water i.e., controlled by output of each nozzle  | Without sufficient leaching (most drip systems are designed for high efficiency, meaning little or no leaching fraction), salts applied with the irrigation water may build up in the root zone  |
| Usually operated at lower pressure than other types of pressurized irrigation, reducing energy costs | |

## Cost Consideration

As already mentioned, commercial systems for industrial production are very expensive. Small scale farmers can buy a drip irrigation system for relatively low initial costs (US$15 to $85) or construct it with local available material (buckets, bamboo or plastic pips)(INFONET-BIOVISION 2010). In general, it is more costly than manual irrigation, but has improved yields and decreased water/ operating costs.
