# Portable Power Supply for the Raspberry-Pi

- Raspberry-Pi requires 5V/2.5A to be supplied to its micro-USB port.
- We could plug our board to a regular power source (i.e. local electric grid or any electric generator) which delivers 5V/2.5A. However, this limits the portability of our *Smart Irrigation Controller*
- We could use a renewable energy source, like solar energy.
