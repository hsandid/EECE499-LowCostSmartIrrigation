- **Processor :** 

  - Broadcom BCM2837B0, Cortex-A53 (ARMv8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.4GHz (Quad-core processor).
  
- **More about Processors :**

  - 32-bit processor vs 64-bit processor :

    - 32-bit processors support up to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^{32} "> bytes of memory, or around <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=4">GB of memory.
    - 64-bit processors support up to <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^{64} "> bytes of memory, or around  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=17*10^{9}"> GB of memory.

  - Raspberry-Pi OS (*a.k.a.* Raspbian OS) only has a 32-bit version. It is designed to run on all Raspberry-Pi boards, including earlier versions which had a 32-bit processors only.

    - 64-bit processors support both 32-bit and 64-bit OSes.
    - 32-bit processors support only 32-bit OSes.

  - 32-bit support is being slowly dropped. We may have to migrate our system to a 64-bit system, and 64-bit software.

    

- **Networking :**

  - Dual-band wireless LAN / 2.4GHz and 5GHz IEEE 802.11.b/g/n/ac Wireless LAN
  - Bluetooth 4.2/BLE (Bluetooth Low-Energy)
  - Ethernet port
  - Power-over-Ethernet support (Needs separate module)

    - GPIO input pins can be read as high (3.3V) or low (0V).
      - Internal pull-up or pull-down resistors are present on each pins. Pins GPIO2-GPIO3 have fixed pull-up resistors, but other pins can be configured in software.
    - Raspberry-Pi supports Pulse-Width modulation
      - Pulse width modulated signal frequency and duty-cycle can be modified.
      - Software Pulse-Width Modulation is available on all GPIO pins.
      - Hardware Pulse-Width Modulation is available on pins GPIO12, GPIO13, GPIO18, GPIO19.
    - Raspberry-Pi supports SPI over it's UART interface
      - SPI0: MOSI (GPIO10); MISO (GPIO9); SCLK (GPIO11); CE0 (GPIO8), CE1 (GPIO7)
      - SPI1: MOSI (GPIO20); MISO (GPIO19); SCLK (GPIO21); CE0 (GPIO18); CE1 (GPIO17); CE2 (GPIO16)
