# Week #2 (June 15th)

### Web Interface for the Smart Irrigation Controller 

- Repository has been setup [here](https://github.com/hsandid/SmartIrrigationSystem_WebInterface)

- Walkthrough of the prototype dashboard

- What features can be added in each page ?

### Deploying a Raspberry-Pi prototype in the field

I need to conduct a feasibility study before moving on to the implementation.

- Meeting with experts from the agriculture department
   - What irrigation systems (i.e. pumps, actuators...) should I expect the Raspberry-Pi to interact with ? Is it possible to design a universal system which is compatible with all common irrigation systems (both hardware/software) ?
   
- Enclosure for the Raspberry-Pi to protect it when deployed outdoors on agricultural fields (i.e. bad weather, physical shock...).

- Find a way to power the Raspberry-Pi device efficiently in the field. ( Portable battery pack ? Solar Power ? )

### Setting Date for the Code reviews

- Code review for the Rasp-Py routines ? (needs 30 mins)
   - Python code

- Code review for the mobile application ? (needs 1h30 - 2h)
   - Java Code with some XML => Need to prepare a code review which focuses on the concepts rather than syntax/semantics of Java.
