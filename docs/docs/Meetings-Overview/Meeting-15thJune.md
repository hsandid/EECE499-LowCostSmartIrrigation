# Week #2 (June 15th)

- Work Completed
   - Web Interface prototype, for the Raspberry-Pi

### Deploying a Raspberry-Pi prototype in the field

I need to conduct a feasibility study before moving on to the implementation.

- Meeting with experts from the agriculture department
   - What irrigation systems (i.e. pumps, actuators...) should I expect the Raspberry-Pi to interact with ? Is it possible to design a universal system which is compatible with all common irrigation systems (both hardware/software) ?
   
- Enclosure for the Raspberry-Pi to protect it when deployed outdoors on agricultural fields (i.e. bad weather, physical shock...).

- Find a way to power the Raspberry-Pi device efficiently in the field. ( Portable battery pack ? Solar Power ? )

### Code Review

We must agree on a time to conduct a code review for the Raspberry-Pi scripts and web interface, and also the Mobile application.
