# Week #1 (June 8th)


- Considering the current situation, we need to discuss the logistics of some aspects (i.e. Meeting with agriculture experts, work in the field, ordering required hardware like the LoRa interface...). 

- During this first meeting, we have discussed the scope of my work on the *Smart Irrigation Controller*

  - Developing a working prototype for the *Smart Irrigation Controller*, targeted to run on a Raspberry-Pi.

  - Maintaining the Mobile Application tied to the *Smart Irrigation Controller*, and add any features if considered necessary.
