# Week #1 (June 8th)

### Internship Work Scope

I will be continuing my work on the following :

- Working on the Smart Irrigation Controller (Continuation of EECE 499). Considering the current situation, we need to discuss the feasibility of some aspects (i.e. Meeting with agriculture experts, work in the field, ordering required hardware like the LoRa interface...). 
- Mobile Application, polishing it and making sure it's ready for release. (Refactoring the code, Writing documentation...). If you are interested, we could organize a code review session.

### Misc. Issues

- FYP with Imad/Mohammad on the vector processor.
