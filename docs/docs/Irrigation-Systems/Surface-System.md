# Surface Irrigation System

## Overview

Surface irrigation is mainly divided in basin, border, and furrow systems. It is widely utilized and therefore a well-known system, which  can be operated without any high-tech applications. In general, it is more labor intensive than other irrigation methods. Proper design of  surface irrigation systems takes into account the soil type (texture and intake rate), slope, levelness of the field, stream size, and length of run. It is generally more difficult to obtain high uniformity of water  distribution in long fields on coarse textured soils (gravel and sands)  than on fine textured soils (loams to clay) (HILL 2008).

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Because it is so widely utilised, local irrigators generally have at least minimal understanding of how to operate and maintain the system | The soil, which must be used to convey the water over the field, has properties that are highly varied both spatially and temporally  |
| Surface irrigation systems can be developed at the farm level with minimal capital investment | Surface irrigation systems are typically less efficient in applying water than either sprinkler or trickle systems  |
| The essential structural elements are located at the edges of the fields, which facilitates operation and maintenance activities  | The need to use the field surface as a conveyance and distribution facility requires that fields be well graded if possible |
| If the topography is not too undulating, these costs are not great | Surface systems tend to be labour-intensive  |
| Energy requirements for surface irrigation systems come from gravity | |
| Surface irrigation systems are less affected by climatic and water quality characteristics  | |
| The gravity flow system is a highly flexible, relatively easily managed method of irrigation  | |


## Cost Consideration

Levelling the fields and building the water ditches and reservoirs might be expensive, but once this is done, costs are low and the self-help capacity is very high. Thus, the expected life of the system, fixed  costs, and annual operation costs (energy, water depreciation, land  preparation, maintenance, labor, taxes, etc.) should be included in the analysis when selecting an irrigation system . The water  allocation is done by gravity, therefore no energy is required. On the other hand, a surface irrigation system is labor intensive, which  should be considered.
