# Sprinkler Irrigation System

## Overview

Sprinkler irrigation is a method of providing rainfall-like irrigation to the crops. Water is distributed through a system of pipes usually by pumping. Spray heads at the outlets distribute the water over the entire soil surface. Sprinklers provide efficient coverage for small to large areas and are suitable for all types of crops. Furthermore, they can be adapted to nearly all irrigable soils since sprinklers are available with a variety of discharge capacities. However, sprinkler systems can easily clog with the presence of sediment or debris and large systems incur high capital costs.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| No terracing required | Incurs high operation expenses due to the energy needed for pumping, labor and relatively large investment in equipment: sprinklers and pipes (HOVE 2011) |
| Suitable for almost all types of soil | Sensitivity to wind, causing evaporation losses (HOVE 2011)  |
| Doses, application rates and times adaptable to the needs of the plant and soil type  | The unavoidable wetting of foliage in field crops results in increased sensitivity to diseases (HOVE 2011)  |
| Independent from the topography of the area (even areas located at higher elevations than the source can be irrigated)  | Debris and sediments can cause clogging  |
| Utilization of the entire area with no need for channels (HOVE 2011) | Capital cost is high with greater operational costs due to higher energy requirements (HOVE 2011)  |
| Possibility of adding fertilizers or pesticides | |
| Possibility of irrigating for other purposes: sprouting, frost protection or cooling during hot periods (HOVE 2011)  | |



## Cost Consideration

The costs of the different systems vary. Except for small sprinkler  equipment for gardening, big systems such as linear move or center pivot irrigation incur high capital costs. It is important to also consider  operation and maintenance costs for these technical and sometimes  computer controlled systems.
