# Meeting #6 - July 15th

### Work Completed during this Week

- Setting up a LoRaWAN network
  - Researching possible LoRa transceivers to use with our Raspberry-Pi
  - Researching possible LoRaWAN gateways, either stand-alone or using the Raspberry-Pi
- Web Interface
  - Minor changes made to the UI for a better experience
  - UI now scales properly on mobile

### LoRa Transceivers and LoRaWAN modules

- Research related to LoRa transceivers is available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationSystem/docs/Smart-Irrigation-Controller/Raspberry-Pi-LoRa-LoRaWAN/LoRa-Transceivers/).
- Research related to LoRaWAN gateways is available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationSystem/docs/Smart-Irrigation-Controller/Raspberry-Pi-LoRa-LoRaWAN/LoRaWAN-Gateways/).
- We need to order these modules ASAP to be able to have a working prototype before the end of summer.
  - Any preferred retailer we should order from ?

### Compatibility with Irrigation Systems on the Field

- We want our Smart Irrigation Controller to be compatible with a selection of irrigation systems.
- Words from the experts in agriculture ? If we do not discuss this with them ASAP, it will be tough to have something ready by the end of summer.
- Should I conduct my own research on the matter ?

### Discussing the features of the Final prototype

- Considering some of the work that still needs to be done, what features should we aim for in the final prototype ?

### Using QR code to add fields from the web interface to the Raspberry-Pi

- To be discussed ...
