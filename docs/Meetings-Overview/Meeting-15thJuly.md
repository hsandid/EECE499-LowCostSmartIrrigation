# Meeting #6 - July 15th

### Work Completed during this Week

- Setting up a LoRaWAN network
  - Researching possible LoRa transceivers to use with our Raspberry-Pi. Research available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationSystem/docs/Smart-Irrigation-Controller/Raspberry-Pi-LoRa-LoRaWAN/LoRa-Transceivers/).
  - Researching possible LoRaWAN gateways, either stand-alone or using the Raspberry-Pi. Research available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationSystem/docs/Smart-Irrigation-Controller/Raspberry-Pi-LoRa-LoRaWAN/LoRaWAN-Gateways/).
- Web Interface
  - Minor changes made to the UI for a better experience
  - UI now scales properly on mobile
  - Demo available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationController-WebInterface/).

### LoRa Transceivers and LoRaWAN modules

- Research related to LoRa transceivers is available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationSystem/docs/Smart-Irrigation-Controller/Raspberry-Pi-LoRa-LoRaWAN/LoRa-Transceivers/).
- Research related to LoRaWAN gateways is available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationSystem/docs/Smart-Irrigation-Controller/Raspberry-Pi-LoRa-LoRaWAN/LoRaWAN-Gateways/).
- We need to order these modules ASAP to be able to have a working prototype before the end of summer.
  - Any preferred retailer we should order from ?

### Compatibility with Irrigation Systems on the Field

- We want our Smart Irrigation Controller to be compatible with a selection of irrigation systems.
- This should be discussed with agriculture experts of the Levantine team.

### Using QR code to add fields from the web interface to the Raspberry-Pi

- Discussion around the concept. Maybe it could be added later after we are done with the basic design of the *Smart Irrigation Controller* ?
