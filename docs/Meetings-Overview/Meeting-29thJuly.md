# Meeting #8 - July 29th

### Work Completed during this Week

- PCB Development
	 - Developed a prototype PCB which connects to the Raspberry-Pi's 40-pin GPIO header, allowing it to interface with a LoRa Transceiver or a GSM module, their compatible antennas, and offering a practical interface to the Raspberry-Pi's available GPIO pins.
	 - The prototype PCB supports UART-Compatible LoRa OR GSM module.
	 - Work Report Available [here]().
	
- Low-Power Mode for the Raspberry-Pi
	 - Research about the estimated power consumption of the Raspberry-Pi 3 Model B and Raspberry-Pi Zero under minimum and maximum load.
	 - Research more about a developing a 'Low-Power Mode' for the Raspberry-Pi, which will use a combination of CRON jobs, Web interface, and interfacing with the LoRa & GSM modules.
	 - Research Report Available [here]().

- Miscellaneous changes
	 - Added hyperlinks in previous meetings page, as requested.
	 - Added GPIO pins reference in the Raspberry-Pi Diagram, as requested.
