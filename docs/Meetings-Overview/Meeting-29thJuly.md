# Meeting #8 - July 29th

### Work Completed during this Week

- PCB Development
	 - Developed a prototype PCB which connects to the Raspberry-Pi's 40-pin GPIO header, allowing it to interface with a LoRa Transceiver or a GSM module, their compatible antennas, and offering a practical interface to the Raspberry-Pi's available GPIO pins.
	 - The prototype PCB is available in two format : (1) UART-Compatible LoRa or GSM module, (2) SPI-Compatible LoRa or GSM module.
	 - Add link to research...
	 - Battery Holder (?)

- Low-Power Mode for the Raspberry-Pi
	 - Research about the estimated power consumption of the Raspberry-Pi 3 Model B and Raspberry-Pi Zero under minimum and maximum load.
	 - Research more about a developing a 'Low-Power Mode' for the Raspberry-Pi, which will use a combination of CRON jobs, Web interface, and interfacing with the LoRa & GSM modules.
	 - Add link to research...

- Web Interface (Demo available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationController-WebInterface/))
	 - Changes made to the Registration Process
	 - Changes made to the History Tab
	 - Changes made to the Scheduler Tab

- Miscellaneous changes
	 - Added hyperlinks in previous meetings page, as requested.
	 - Added GPIO pins reference in the Raspberry-Pi Diagram, as requested. There are two versions, one with the UART-compatible modules and one with the SPI-compatible modules.
