# Meeting #7 - July 22th

### Work Completed during this Week

- Research on GSM module compatible with the Raspberry-Pi
- Smart Irrigation Controller Diagram
- Web Interface
  - Minor changes made to the UI for a better experience

---

### Low-Power mode for the Raspberry-Pi

- No built-in low-power mode
- We can use an external clock module, but it doesn't allow for much user freedom in setting intervals...

### Flow meters

- Any update on the flow meters ?

### GSM module for the Raspberry-Pi

- Research related to GSM modules is available [here](https://hsandid.github.io/SmartIrrigationSystem/docs/Smart-Irrigation-Controller/Raspberry-Pi-GSM/).
